      Do you long for a simpler time, when America was Online and the only person you
      could Ask was Jeeves? Hotline Webring is bringing that time back, with
      Webrings!
    </p>

    <p>
      In the 90s, search engines were of generally low quality, and people wanted
      a way to discover related sites. &ldquo;I wish I could see more sites about
      puppies,&rdquo; you might say to yourself over the sonorous clang of your
      modem, while waiting for
      <a href="/clumber-spaniel.bmp">a bitmap of a Clumber Spaniel</a>
      to load.
    </p>

    <p>
      So people with websites joined webrings, which were collections of sites
      where each site linked to their neighbors to form a ring.  Sometimes there
      was one button on each site that'd take you to a random site in the webring.
      People got more traffic and less-popular sites benefited from being linked
      to more-popular ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, in <%= Date.current.year %> C.E., there are search engines and
      aggregators so finding related sites isn't that hard, and webrings have
      fallen by the wayside.
    </p>

    <p>
      We here at Hotline Webring traveled to the wayside, picked up The Concept of
      a Webring, dusted it off, and launched it to frankly astonishing acclaim.

    </section>
    <p>Here's our easy two-and-a-half-step process:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Choose a unique slug. If your website were http://gabebw.com, you might use
        <strong>gabebw</strong>. Using something based on your website is a good
        idea because it's likely to be unique.</li>
      <li>Add links on your website to <strong>https://hotlinewebring.club/YOUR-SLUG/next</strong> and <strong>https://hotlinewebring.club/YOUR-SLUG/previous</strong></li>
      <li>You're done! When someone clicks on one of your links, you'll be automatically added to the webring.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>

    <p>
      Q: Can I control who I link to?</br>
      A: No, sorry, it's all automatic. But on the bright side it's easy to sign up!
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: How can I reach the people who run this thing?</br>
      A: Email us! We're always delighted to receive email: <%= mail_to "webmaster@hotlinewebring.club" %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: Do you allow <em>any</em> website into Hotline Webring?</br>
      A: Hotline Webring accepts many sites, but not all. We want sites that show
      off someone's <strong>individual personality</strong>. We also draw the line
      at a few specific places:</br>
      </br>
      <ul>
        <li>Hate speech</li>
        <li>Racism, sexism, any kind of bigotry</li>
        <li>Advertisement-focused sites</li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      Any site exhibiting these qualities will be removed.</br>
      </br>
      It is impossible to enumerate everything that is not allowed. For this reason, we reserve the right to remove a site if we (the webmasters) feel it is outside of our own personal bounds. If you want to know if your site is acceptable for the webring, please <%= mail_to "webmaster@hotlinewebring.club", "email us" %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: Is my slug taken?</br>
      A: You tell me:

      <table class="redirections">
        <tr>
          <th>Slug</th>
          <th>URL</th>
        </tr>
        <%= render @redirections %>
      </table>
