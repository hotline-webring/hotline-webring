      Do you long for a simpler time, when America was Online and the only person you
      could Ask was Jeeves? Hotline Webring is bringing that time back, with
      Webrings!
    </p>

    <p>
      In the 90s, search engines were of generally low quality, and people wanted
      a way to discover related sites. &ldquo;I wish I could see more sites about
      puppies,&rdquo; you might say to yourself over the sonorous clang of your
      modem, while waiting for
      <a href="/clumber-spaniel.bmp">a bitmap of a Clumber Spaniel</a>
      to load.
    </p>

    <p>
      So people with websites joined webrings, which were collections of sites
      where each site linked to their neighbors to form a ring.  Sometimes there
      was one button on each site that'd take you to a random site in the webring.
      People got more traffic and less-popular sites benefited from being linked
      to more-popular ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, in <%= Date.current.year %> C.E., there are search engines and
      aggregators so finding related sites isn't that hard, and webrings have
      fallen by the wayside.
    </p>

    <p>
      We here at Hotline Webring traveled to the wayside, picked up The Concept of
      a Webring, dusted it off, and launched it to frankly astonishing acclaim.

    <p>Here's our easy two-and-a-half-step process:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Choose a unique "slug", or short code. For example, if your website were http://gabebw.com, you might use
        <strong>gabebw</strong>. Using something based on your website is a good
        idea because it's likely to be unique.</li>
      <li>Add links on your website to your slug. The links should be to <code>/next</code> and <code>/previous</code>, like this:
        <ul>
          <li>https://hotlinewebring.club/YOUR-SLUG/next</li>
          <li>https://hotlinewebring.club/YOUR-SLUG/previous</li>
          <li>
            <strong>A hot(line) tip</strong>: don't literally use YOUR-SLUG. It is already taken. Replace
            "YOUR-SLUG" with whatever you want your actual slug to be.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Another hot(line) tip</strong>: put your links on your coolest page. We look at
            every site that joins and ensure visitors land on the page with the
            webring links. This lets people click through every site in the
            webring.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You're done! When someone clicks on one of your links, you'll be automatically added to the webring.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>

    <p>
      Q: Can I control who I link to?</br>
      A: No, sorry, it's all automatic. But on the bright side it's easy to sign up!
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: How can I reach the people who run this thing?</br>
      A: Email us! We're always delighted to receive email: <%= mail_to email_address %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: Do you allow <em>any</em> website into Hotline Webring?</br>
      A: Hotline Webring accepts many sites, but not all. We want sites that show
      off someone's <strong>individual personality</strong>. We also draw the line
      at a few specific places:</br>
      </br>
      <ul>
        <li>Hate speech</li>
        <li>Racism, sexism, any kind of bigotry</li>
        <li>Advertisement-focused sites</li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      Any site exhibiting these qualities will be removed.</br>
      </br>
      It is impossible to enumerate everything that is not allowed. For this reason, we reserve the right to remove a site if we (the webmasters) feel it is outside of our own personal bounds. If you want to know if your site is acceptable for the webring, please <%= email_us %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: Is my slug taken?</br>
      A: You tell me:

      <table class="redirections">
        <tr>
          <th>Slug</th>
          <th>URL</th>
        </tr>
        <%= render @redirections %>
      </table>
