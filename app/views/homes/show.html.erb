    Do you long for a simpler time, when America was Online and the only person you
    could Ask was Jeeves? Hotline Webring is bringing that time back, with
    Webrings!
  </p>

  <p>
    In the 90s, search engines were of generally low quality, and people wanted
    a way to discover related sites. &ldquo;I wish I could see more sites about
    puppies,&rdquo; you might say to yourself over the sonorous clang of your
    modem, while waiting for
    <a href="/clumber-spaniel.bmp">a bitmap of a Clumber Spaniel</a>
    to load.
  </p>

  <p>
    So people with websites joined webrings, which were collections of sites
    where each site linked to their neighbors to form a ring.  Sometimes there
    was one button on each site that'd take you to a random site in the webring.
    People got more traffic and less-popular sites benefited from being linked
    to more-popular ones.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, in <%= Date.current.year %> C.E., there are search engines and
    aggregators so finding related sites isn't that hard, and webrings have
    fallen by the wayside.
  </p>

  <p>
    We here at Hotline Webring traveled to the wayside, picked up The Concept of
    a Webring, dusted it off, and launched it to frankly astonishing acclaim.
  </p>

  <h3>How to Join</h3>
  <p>Here's our easy two-and-a-half-step process:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Choose a unique slug. If your website were http://gabebw.com, you might use
      <strong>gabebw</strong>. Using something based on your website is a good
      idea because it's likely to be unique.</li>
    <li>Add links on your website to <strong>https://hotlinewebring.club/YOUR-SLUG/next</strong> and <strong>https://hotlinewebring.club/YOUR-SLUG/previous</strong></li>
    <li>You're done! When someone clicks on one of your links, you'll be automatically added to the webring.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>FAQ</h3>

  <p>
    Q: Can I control who I link to?</br>
    A: No, sorry, it's all automatic. But on the bright side it's easy to sign up!
  </p>

  <p>
    Q: How can I reach the people who run this thing?</br>
    A: Email us! We're always delighted to receive email: <%= mail_to "webmaster@hotlinewebring.club" %>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Q: Do you allow <em>any</em> website into Hotline Webring?</br>
    A: Hotline Webring accepts many sites, but not all. Generally, commercial
    websites are not allowed. We also draw the line at a few specific
    places:</br>
    </br>
    <ul>
      <li>Hate speech</li>
      <li>Racism, sexism, any kind of bigotry</li>
      <li>Advertisement focused sites</li>
    </ul>
    </br>
    Any site exhibiting these qualities will be removed.</br>
    </br>
    It is impossible to enumerate everything that is not allowed. For this reason, we reserve the right to remove a site if we (the webmasters) feel it is outside of our own personal bounds. If you want to know if your site is acceptable for the webring, please <%= mail_to "webmaster@hotlinewebring.club", "email us" %>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Q: Is my slug taken?</br>
    A: You tell me:

    <table class="redirections">
      <tr>
        <th>Slug</th>
        <th>URL</th>
      </tr>
      <%= render @redirections %>
    </table>
